# Introduction



# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

Plot of the original data:

We started by selecting all the hazard functions to look into all the possible models based on the original plot of data.

Going to the model comparison tab, we can see a sorted table. We select to sort log-likelihood to choose our 2 best model. Log likelihood is the natural algorithm for the likelihood function, the likelihood function measures the probability of the observed data given certain parameters. The higher the log-likelihood, the better the model fits the data.

by sorting it, we see that ----- and ----- have the highest log-likelihood with our original failure data.

This is the failure intensity and reliablilty graph as well as the two chosen predicted models.
